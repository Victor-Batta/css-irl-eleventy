Last week I had the honour of participating in [Dev Roulette Live](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmAXY1OelfjilsGMHGmVdIQ) â€” a new video series co-ordinated by [Stephanie Eckles](https://twitter.com/5t3ph), where developers are paired up for live conversation about their specialist subjects. The added twist is a roulette wheel, spun at different points to choose topics at random. One of my favourite things to do is talk about CSS, so this was super fun to be a part of!

I was also really excited to meet [Bramus](https://twitter.com/bramus), who I was paired up with. Bramus has a [fantastic blog](https://www.bram.us/) that covers loads of useful tips and bleeding-edge CSS features. In the conversation we talked about our favourite CSS tricks, creativity, why we do what we do, and much more. Enjoy the video!
