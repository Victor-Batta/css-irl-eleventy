I recently had the priviledge of chatting to Phil Burgess on the [IT Career Energizer Podcast](https://itcareerenergizer.com/) about my journey into web development, and advice to new developers starting out on that path. You can [listen to the episode here](https://itcareerenergizer.com/podcast/learn-from-your-communities-and-remember-that-learning-is-fun-with-michelle-barker/) — it’s also available on all your favourite podcast platforms (Spotify, Apple Podcasts and more)!
